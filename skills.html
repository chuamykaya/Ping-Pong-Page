<p> Learning the skills of ping-pong is probably the most fun part. It can seem kinda technical at the start, but with lot's of practice you'll get the muscle memory.
Since ping-pong relies heavily on spin, the techniques you'll need to master to be a pro relate to generating three kinds of spin: 
<span style="font-weight:bold">Top-spin, under-spin, side-spin.</span> </p>
<h2>Top-spin</h2>
<p>Top-spin is probably the most common kind of spin you'll encounter or use when you try to receive/return a ball. 
As the name suggests, the effect the spin will have as the ball contacts the racket, is to make the ball move upward. 
How do you know the ball is top-spin? Well, any upward motion when the racket contacts the ball will produce top-spin (i.e. think physics).
This first video teaches the basics of how to generate a forehand top-spin ball...</p>

<p>Of course, that's just a basic top-spin forehand stroke. If you really want to get a lot of spin, which will make the ball accelerate really fast and have a "springing" effect when it touches the opponent's side of the table, 
the key is to coordinate your leg, waist and arm movement. Think of it like a set of gears; the biggest "gear" is the leg movement aspect, the smallest "gear" is the strength of your forearm. You won't want to use the smallest gear to get things moving, because you'll have less power.
Similarly, don't make the rookie mistake of generating spin mainly through your forearm/arm strength. 
Most of the power you generate should come from your leg movement, then waist rotation, followed by forearm.
The leg-movement and waist-rotation is really the key. 
If your top-spin is good, you can use it to receive an under-spin ball (literally reversing its spin), 
and it'll be quite difficult for the opponent to receive the ball because its fast and forceful. </p>
<p> Here's another video that demonstrates a good top-spin. Ummm it's in Chinese (bcos the best players are usually Chinese), but just take note of how he generates the top-spin by rotating his waist, and using that to connect to and "push" his forearm. As you can see, these two movements are connected in a single burst (usually where the ball contacts the racket beyond the waist area), and the rest of the action (till your racket reaches eye-level) is just a follow-up stroke. </p>

<p> Top-spin (and all spins really) can also be generated by the backhand stroke. Think of the backhand stroke as a combination of a backhand frisbee flick and the action you'll use when drawing out a Samurai sword. Does that make sense? Well, this video will explain it! </p>

<h2>Under Spin</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, the direction of this spin is anti-clockwise, which means that the ball tends downwards when it contacts the racket.
When the spin is very heavy, the ball also tends to roll backwards toward the net. Under-spin is used very effectively in service, like this short video will demonstrate: </p>
<iframe width= "510" height ="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GUbDgh_Ks9Q" class="container two"/> </iframe> 
<p>Amazingly, under-spin can also be employed in a "defensive" mode of playing, where the player returns the ball by "cutting" it. 
Underspin is usually received by applying back the same spin through a forehand or backhand cut, or by applying heavy top-spin through a forehand or backhand loop. 
Watch this video which demonstrates the "defensive" mode of playing.</p>

<h2>Side Spin</h2>
<p>The last sort of spin is side-spin, which makes the ball tend to move sideways (right or left) when it contacts the racket. 
Usually, side-spin is used in service as well, and if the ball is positioned well towards the corner of the table, side-spin is effective in causing the ball to "fly" out of court when the opponent receives it.
The tricky thing about side-spin is that it can be combined with under-spin and top-spin, which means that the motion of the ball and the way it is received is different. 
But by far, one of the coolest and deadliest ways to use side-spin is with the forehand loopï¼Œwhich some parts of this video will show <span style="font-weight:bold">(just click the Youtube link):</span> </p>
