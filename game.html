<p>Ping pong, more formally known as table-tennis, is a racket sport popular in Asia and Europe. Supposedly, it was first invented in early 20th century England.
Since then, ping-pong has gained its popularity outside of the European sphere, and become somewhat of an international sport. Today, the sport is dominated by the Chinese, who produce top-class world players. 
Ping-poing relies heavily upon <span style= "font-weight: bold">spin </span> generated by contact between the table-tennis racket (or rather its rubber sheet) and the ball. 
Without spin, the game simply will not work!</p>
<p>In this section, I'm going to introduce you to how the game is played, so that you'll understand the basic flow of the game.
Let's get started...</p>
<h2>The basic rules</h2>
<img src="doubles.jpg" alt="doubles.jpg" class="img.a">
<p> If you didn't already know, you need two players for a game of ping-pong.  
The game begins with the first player serving the ball to the other player. 
The ball must bounce twice (once on your side of the table, once on the other player's side) for it to be valid. 
If the other player can return the ball to your side of the table, the game goes on. If not, you have earned one point. 
If the other player returns your serve successfully, the game goes on until one player fails to return the ball to the opponent's side of the table, in which case one point is earned by the player who last returned the ball.</p>
<p>You'll get to serve twice, before it's the other players turn to serve. 
The winner of the game is the first person to reach 11 points. In case of a tie (10-10), each of you will serve once instead of twice, and the first person to get a two-point advantage wins (e.g. 12-10, 13-11 etc). 
Ping-pong may be played as a singles (2 players) or doubles (4 players) game. The rules for service and taking turns to receive/return the ball are slightly different for doubles.
In case you got nothing of what I just said, here's a video that explains it all! </p>
